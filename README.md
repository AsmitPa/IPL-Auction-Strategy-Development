Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive auction strategy for a new Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise by analyzing historical IPL data from the first season to the 13th season (held in 2020). The project focuses on building a balanced and competitive squad using data-driven insights derived from SQL queries.

Motive
The goal is to create a strong and well-balanced squad by analyzing various types of players, including batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and wicketkeepers. Key factors such as player performance, form, and value are considered to inform decisions during the IPL auction.

Background
The IPL is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India, which has garnered global attention since its inception in 2007. With the inclusion of new teams and players, IPL auctions play a critical role in determining team composition and future success.

The project involves:

Budget allocation for player purchases.
Team requirements based on roles such as aggressive batsmen, finishers, bowlers, and wicketkeepers.
Player form and availability analysis using performance metrics from past seasons.
Data-driven auction strategy to optimize squad selection.
Data
The project uses IPL data from seasons 1 to 13, covering player performance metrics such as:

Batting stats: Runs, strike rate, average, boundary percentage, etc.
Bowling stats: Economy, strike rate, wickets taken, etc.
Other stats: Player dismissals, match venues, and team compositions.
SQL Queries
Several SQL queries were used to analyze player performance and determine the best players for the franchise. Here are some key queries:

1. Bidding on Batters:
Aggressive Batsmen: Players with high strike rates (S.R) who have faced at least 500 balls. These players provide quick runs and set the pace for the team.
Anchor Batsmen: Players with a good average and the ability to build solid partnerships.
Finishers: Batsmen who can score runs quickly in the final overs.

2. Bidding on Bowlers:
Economical Bowlers: Bowlers who have bowled at least 500 balls with a low economy rate.
Wicket-Taking Bowlers: Players with a high wicket-taking ability and a good strike rate.

3. Bidding on All-Rounders:
Players with strong performance both in batting and bowling, offering flexibility to the team.

4. Wicketkeepers:
Wicketkeepers with strong batting skills and crucial defensive roles in T20.

Additional Analysis:

Match Venues: Analyzing cities that have hosted IPL matches.
Boundaries and Dot Balls: Fetching data on boundaries and dot balls bowled by each team.
Extra Runs: Identifying top bowlers who conceded maximum extra runs.
Year-wise analysis of runs scored at different venues.
Strategy Development

The strategy includes:

Bidding on key players: Focus on acquiring aggressive batsmen, economical bowlers, and strong all-rounders.
Team composition: Balance between experienced and young players in various roles.
Budget management: Ensuring optimal use of the available budget for high-performing players.

Visualizations

The project includes various visual representations like graphs, tables, and charts to summarize the analysis. These visualizations are presented to the team management before the auction to assist in decision-making.

Additional Questions for Assessment
The final assessment involves answering several key questions through SQL queries, such as:

Count of cities that have hosted an IPL match.
Fetching the total number of boundaries and dot balls.
Identifying the top bowlers who conceded maximum extra runs.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be effectively used to analyze IPL data and develop a data-driven auction strategy. By leveraging historical performance data, the franchise can build a strong and balanced team for future IPL seasons.
